Hello and welcome!
My name is Nixton and I am passionate about all things computers, technology and hacking. 
I spend much of my time exploring these fascinating areas and immersing myself in research around them. My interest in 
the world of technology pushes me to constantly learn new things and stay up to date. Hope you also find these topics as exciting as I do!
